# Competitive Programming 2

Solutions of some questions in the Book "Competitive Programming Book 2".

This is a book written by two ingenious from China (or another country of Asia, IDK) who win everything that possible and try to learn us too.

The most text of book is a shit, but anywhere they provide some questions and consider that we solve them (ye ye).  I try to solve anything that can and want.

In the start of every .cpp file (i solve everything in C++) I try to provide coordinates at the book where that problem was given
